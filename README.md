Around <strong data-end="1229" data-start="1173">15% of adults experience some degree of hearing loss</strong>, and many more suffer from tinnitus (ringing in the ears), sensitivity to sound, or a feeling of fullness or discomfort in the ears.</p>
<p data-end="1519" data-start="1364">These issues aren&rsquo;t just inconvenient &mdash; they can affect your mood, relationships, focus, and overall quality of life. Hearing problems are often linked to:</p>
